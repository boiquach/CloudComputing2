                  Our goal at Keep Vietnam Clean & Green (KVCG) is to raise
                  awareness about the litter & trash problem in Vietnam. While
                  we understand there are many other issues that impact the
                  environment, our focus is on littering, as we believe it to be
                  the most basic of environmental issues and the foundational
                  basis of environmental education. We believe, “How can we
                  educate people about issues like climate change, sustainable
                  building, reusable energies and recycling when we can’t get
                  the general population to stop littering?”

                  Our first program, started in June 2013, was the Green Ribbon
                  Campaign that won the international Youth4Asia competition
                  sponsored by the Asian Development Bank in 2015 when we worked
                  with 15 universities in Vietnam to get over 40,000 pledges to
                  not litter. We were honored to present our program to the
                  Environment Ministers of all the countries in the Greater
                  Mekong Region in Myanmar and then again in 2016 at the Asia
                  Youth Conference in the Philippines.

                  In April 2015, we started our second program the Community
                  Clean Ups on Phu Quoc Island. We have, since then, also
                  organized clean ups in Han Noi, HCMC, Hoi An, Hue and Can Tho
                  and have engaged over organizations to join the clean ups.

                  In 2016, we developed the characters for the Green Turtle
                  Army, a campaign targeting children. We are excited as these
                  mascots will educate children about the negative impacts of
                  littering. Our partners in this effort are (1) RMIT
                  University’s Centre of Communication and Design, whose
                  students designed the characters and (2) Saigon South
                  International School, whose elementary and middle school
                  students helped to create activities based on the Green Turtle
                  Army characters.

                <h4>Our Inspiration</h4>
                <p>
                  In developed countries, organizations that combat litter are
                  numerous. We draw our inspiration from them and aspire to be
                  like them. Our main source of inspiration is the four
                  organizations below, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Keep America Beautiful (founded in 1953)</li>
                  <li>Keep Britain Tidy (founded in 1955)</li>
                  <li>Keep Australia Beautiful (founded in 1969)</li>
                  <li>Don’t Mess With Texas (founded in 1985)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Since all of them were established for so many years ago and
                  still exist until today, we believe that this battle will take
                  patience and endurance.
